# To-do-list
this is a todo app with email and password authentication built using mern stack

I used MERN stack for developing this to do list

React for frontend, 
MongoDB as a database,
Nodejs for backend,
Express for connecting backend and frontend

How to use ToDo list: 

create an account -> log in to your account -> add tasks by clicking "add task " button -> you can mark, unmark the tasks and also delete the tasks , the tasks will be 
deleted after the due date;
